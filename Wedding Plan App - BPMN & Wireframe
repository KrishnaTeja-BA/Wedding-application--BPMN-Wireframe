# Wedding Plan-application--BPMN-Wireframe
## Wedding Plan Mobile Application Design- BPMN Model created in Lucidchart; Wireframe designed using Balsamiq

## Project Overview
This project illustrates the user flow and wireframe design for a wedding planning mobile application. It allows users to browse the wedding plans, choosing venues, confirm bookings and making payments through a simple and friendly- user interface.

## Concept
The goal of this design is to create an effective experience for users planning their weddings. It helps to choose them suitable packages and venues- all in one platform

## BPMN Model Overview 
The BPMN (Business Process model and Notation) flowchart demonstrates the structure of the application journey from opening to completing the event booking process.

## Future Improvements
  As a beginner, I Creator these models to gain more experience in design and application structure.
  In Future Updates, I plan to enhance the project by:
  Adding backend logic structure
  Linking more Screens for dropdown lists, bookings, and payments
